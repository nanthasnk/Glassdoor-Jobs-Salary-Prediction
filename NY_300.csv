We're looking to add a Senior Data Scientist to our data team to lead modeling efforts around risk and fraud.

Data is at the center of our product and mission at Alloy - we are part of the core Product and Engineering group, and our work directly contributes to the product's decision support capabilities around fraud and risk. You'll work with a modern tech and data science stack - Postgres, Python (pandas, scikit-learn, jupyter), R, AWS on the data team - alongside friendly coworkers that collaboration, flexible work arrangements, working reproducibly, testing, and software craftsmanship. You'll be a valued member of a friendly and experienced engineering team, working closely with backend and frontend engineers. Our data team's culture values curiosity, learning, connecting data to Alloy's strategy, open source tools, rigor, and a spirit of relentless resourcefulness.

If you are analytical, good at taking on big, complex questions, and like the pace and career growth opportunities afforded by working at a fast-growing early stage startup, then we'd like to meet you! Come join an exciting startup company in the FinTech space named one of Forbes Cloud 100 Rising Stars 2019: 20 Up-And-Comers!

What you'll be doing


As the Senior Data Scientist at Alloy, you'll:
Take ownership of our modeling efforts and how modeling happens at Alloy, including how we build, train, deploy and monitor models that help us distinguish 'good' applications from fraud
Ensure that live production models are served with high uptime/reliability and extremely low latency (<150>
Articulate a feature engineering strategy for extracting signal from varied inputs and partner with our data engineering team to build a reliable pipeline to generate, store and use new features in production.
Expand the range of outcomes that we model, expanding beyond basic two-category classification to more robust models that identify particular fraud modalities
Deploy time-series models that score streams of transaction data and integrate with our onboarding models to provide a real-time view of risk
Hire junior data scientists and build out the data science vertical inside the data team
On a given day, this work might entail:
Analyzing closure data to improve the performance of a fraud model
Applying ML interpretability techniques to help explain and present the most salient features to a particular prediction made by a fraud model
Working with our data engineering team to propose upstream changes in how cleaned training data is made available for modeling
Working with our product team to update the roadmap for the future and vision of our custom modeling product and prioritize what we'll ship in the next quarter
Working with our customer analysis team to add more ML insights to our replicable client analyses
Who we're looking for


Reporting to the Head of Data Science, the Senior Data Scientist will likely have:
A blend of ML/statistics experience and prior experience working on or with software teams to deploy ML models in production

Founded in 2013, Pivotal Software, Inc. combines our leading cloud-native platform, tools, and methodology to empower the world's largest organizations to adapt to change and build great software. Our technology unleashes developer productivity, while fulfilling our mission to transform how the world builds software.

You

As a data scientist on Pivotal's Data Science team, you'll be working on a wide variety of data problems for a diverse range of clients. You will often be asked to learn new technologies and domains on the fly. You should be comfortable working under deadlines and making tough decisions. Consequently, you will frequently have to balance achieving an immediate goal with scalability and productionalizability.

The role offers room for personal and professional growth, and you won't be working in isolation. Data Science at Pivotal is an encouraging and supportive team, where ideas and challenges are addressed collaboratively. We're looking for the kind of person who will try and solve a problem on their own first, but isn't afraid to ask for help or say ""I don't know.""

Us

The Data Science team at Pivotal is primarily a consulting practice; we are tool agnostic, working with our customers to solve real world problems. Our customers, like us, are cross-disciplinary. We service engagements with use cases running from customer churn to optimization to detecting fraud and misconduct. We are not just doers, we are also educators and enablers.

Your Day

While there is no such thing as a ""typical day"", these are activities we frequently find ourselves doing:
Working with clients to uncover and frame new opportunities for data science. Clients often come to us without a clear understanding of what we can do, so this is our chance to open their eyes to new possibilities for their businesses.
Exploring client datasets, looking for actionable insights we can present.
Engineering features, training models, tuning hyperparameters and evaluating the results. We emphasize rigor, because data science done right at this stage leads to models that shine in production.
Taking the models we build into production. This is an exciting stage for anyone who likes collaborating with engineering teams and seeing their model become real when users interact with it.
Helping our clients develop their internal data science practices, from hiring and recruiting to data capturing, so that they can be successful when we hand off the project.
Required Skills / Experiences
Clear and empathetic communicator. You'll be the one sharing your insights with clients and stakeholders at check-ins, documenting your work, and even explaining your model to client data teams as part of a handoff. As such, communication and empathy are essential parts of your toolkit.
Advanced knowledge of statistical modeling and/or machine learning methods. These are the tools we need to go from analysis to prediction.
Strong programming skills. Left to our own devices most of us work in Python, but learning the client's tech stack is an important part of the job.
Strong exploratory data analysis skills. Every engagement starts with an investigation of the data, and thorough EDA saves us a lot of headaches in the long run.
Some travel is expected, depending on location and skillset. We mostly work out of the Pivotal office closest to the client, but sometimes we have to be on site for an extended period of time.
At least a bachelor's degree in an analytical or technical field. This could be applied mathematics, statistics, computer science, operations research, economics, etc. Higher education welcome and encouraged.

This role will support US government clients that require US citizenship. Given this, US citizenship is required for you to apply.
Desired Skills / Experiences
2+ years of work in a data-centric field (data science or data engineering).
Experience with relational databases.
Exposure and experience working in a Linux environment.
You have a specialization in an area like NLP, optimization, or image processing.
Hands-on experience working in a distributed computing environment or proven theoretical understanding of parallelism.

The Trade Desk is a global technology company with a mission to create a better Internet for everyone through principled, intelligent advertising. We help the world's biggest brands reach consumers, and our platform funds content providers and publishers who keep the global Internet free and open for everyone.

Handling over 600 billion queries per day (more than 100X the query volume of search globally), our platform operates at unprecedented scale and generates massive amounts of data. We have also built something even stronger and more valuable: an award-winning culture based on trust, empathy, collaboration, and ownership. By working together across typical dividing lines, we are better as a team than any of us could be apart.

Do you have a passion for solving hard problems at scale? Are you eager to join a trust- based, globally-connected team, where your contributions will make a meaningful difference?

Come and see why Fortune Magazine recently named The Trade Desk among the best small to medium-sized workplaces in the US.

WHO WE ARE LOOKING FOR:


* Our Senior Data Scientists are end-to-end owners. You will participate actively in all aspects of designing, researching, building, and delivering data-focused products for our clients.

* Our Data Science team is embedded into nearly a dozen individual, mission-focused engineering teams working across a wide spectrum of technological and scientific challenges. You will have the opportunity, depending on your interests and background, to work on problems related to natural language processing and machine learning over hundreds of millions of web pages; graph mining and algorithmic optimization on petabytes of data; differential privacy across billions of user IDs; and causal inference with missing data - to name a few.

* Senior Data Scientists contribute to more than our product – they build up our team. Through a combination of mentoring and technical leadership, they make others better and raise the bar for those around them.

WHO YOU ARE:


* You have a sustained track record of making significant, self-directed, and end-to-end contributions to large and impactful machine learning projects. You think beyond just the task at hand to deeply understand the 'why' behind what you are doing.

* You have a strong sense of data intuition. At our scale, many off-the-shelf modeling techniques (open source and enterprise) simply don't work. You are able to work from first principles and intuition to develop solutions and adapt them to a unique environment.

* You are a broadly skilled data scientist with experience embedding models into always-on production systems, working across a variety of technologies and data sources.

* You have a product-focused mindset. You have the passion and ability to contribute to the process of discovering what will delight our clients and push forward one of the world's largest and most influential industries toward a vision of openness, transparency, and evidence-based decision-making.

* You work with confidence and without ego. Our data scientists have deep knowledge and exercise a high degree of leadership in their daily work. You have strongly-held, defensible ideas, and advocate for what you believe is right. You are also adept at identifying and evaluating trade-offs, willing to be proven wrong, and quick to walk through fire to support your fellow teammates.

* You value, seek out, and foster diversity. We are a global team from many diverse backgrounds, with different experiences and perspectives. To complement this team, you will welcome ideas that are different from your own and be skilled at finding and building from common ground.

* You are a creative thinker, not bound by ""the way things have always been done."" What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate. We don't need data scientists who know all the answers; we need data scientists who can invent the answers no one has thought of yet, to the questions yet to be asked.

WHAT YOU WILL BE DOING:


* Our Senior Data Scientists are end-to-end owners. You will participate actively in all aspects of designing, researching, building, and delivering data-focused products for our clients.

* You are you comfortable working on an agile, distributed team spanning multiple time zones and continents.

* You are able to communicate effectively across both technical and non-technical audiences.

* You have over 10 years of experience working in a data-driven role. Some of those years of experience may have been spent pursuing an advanced degree in a quantitative field, but it's not a requirement. What and how you can contribute is what's most important to us which is why our consideration is not limited by the level of education you have.

* You have experience with big data technologies such as Spark or AWS; are able to write efficient SQL; and are proficient in one or more of the following programming languages: R, Python, Java, or Scala. Variety of technical challenge is one of the best things about working at The Trade Desk as a data scientist though which is why we do not expect you to know every technology we use when you start.

Data Scientist:

Job Description

As a data scientist, you will join a talented team to evolve our vision of how we collect, organize, and analyze vast amounts of data. As a data scientist you are familiar that you can only be as good as the underlying data. To that end, you will participate in the definition of data architecture even as you pursue more typical data science modeling and experimental design activities.

The data scientist will contribute to the analytics team as a leader and collaborator with focus in the following areas:

1. Data harmonization – design an extensible data taxonomy for the variety of current and contemplated data sets at our firm. Contribute to development of ETL processes and a data warehouse architecture for curated, clean data staged for analytics.

2. Data reporting – design KPIs and supporting reports for visualization of these KPIs.

3. Report automation – as part of the data harmonization effort, optimize human capital through automation of currently manual processes by centralizing data and rule sets.

4. Data analytics – hypothesis testing, experimental design and execution, machine learning (both supervised and unsupervised as appropriate to the specific use case) for:

a. Dissecting operational and investment performance, identifying drivers thereof.

b. Augmentation of numerous ongoing modeling efforts for market sizing, market access and competitive landscape analysis.

The data scientist will play a critical role in the architecture of data warehouse (with focus on translating semantics from various domains into a harmonized and meaningful schema), even if the execution of this architecture will be assisted by data engineers. Though the scientist should possess a skillset and working knowledge of data engineering principles for purposes of working effectively with data engineers, the scientist role will emphasize generation of data insights more than the mechanics of database implementation. The data scientist will take a direct hands-on role executing statistical modeling, machine learning and QA thereof.

Our firm values heavy collaboration and a culture of communication. The ideal candidate should not only be a world-class data scientist, but effective at communication of complex ideas and concepts.

Before the dawn of everything internet, insurance was intimate and personal. You walked down the street to chat with your broker, and the risk to your business, your livelihood, was covered with a handshake. Today things are different. The average insurance policy for a mom-and-pop store trades through a dozen different hands and traverses a maze of systems and processes. Few are accountable and fewer know the whole story.

Some of the problems you will solve entail understanding data, identifying patterns, quantifying the impact of ML / NLP models and designing data visualizations. We seek a data scientist to help drive a new digital AI product team on a mission to unlock the potential of data and identify new opportunities.

As one of the founding members of a small, multi-disciplinary team of technologists, designers and product managers, you’ll have the freedom to make key product decisions without much oversight, and the tools and resources to build and ship ideas quickly. You’ll be a part of a startup-like environment, with the opportunity to have more control and leadership; in a company with thousands of existing customers.

You have experience with relational databases such as PostgreSQL, Oracle or SQL Server, and maybe even Hadoop, Hive, Spark or Redshift.
You strive to learn the newest and greatest techniques where BERT/ELMo are not just Sesame Street© characters.
What you’ll own
The foundation for advanced analytics at a global company.
The roadmap of projects you’ll work on that tie directly to business goals and objectives.
Manage the entire lifecycle of data projects from strategic planning to tactical activities (data collection, cleanup, analysis, model implementation).
Sourcing new data for a firm that rarely scrapes, pulls or pushes.
Facilitate communication throughout the development process between executive stakeholders, your users and technical teams.
Coordinate and build strong working relations with various internal stakeholder groups, including IT, engineering, and legal.

We have the freedom to explore external data sources and new statistical techniques, and are excited about delivering a whole new generation of Analytical solutions.

In fact, we are designing and will build one of the first multivariate model-based continuous risk differentiations in the industry. This model will incorporate current underwriting best practices (including medical rules) as features and add other data sources, patterns/ideas and variables to essentially create a rating plan to support the next generation underwriting process. This is just one of several projects with large business value. Geographic analytics on agents and customers, application fraud detection, agent success prediction and client prospecting analytics (off-line and on-line) are other exciting examples of enormous incremental value from analytics. Our products will be implemented into real-time core business processes and decisions that drive the company (e.g. underwriting, pricing, agent recruiting, prospecting, new product development).
